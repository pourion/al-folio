<p><i>"When you teach any branch of physics you must motivate the formalism — it isn’t any good just to
		present the formalism and say that it agrees with experiment — you have
		to explain to the students why this [is] the way the world is. After all, this is
		our aim in physics, not just to describe nature, but to explain nature." - Steven Weinberg, 1997</i></p>
