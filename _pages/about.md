Pouria received his PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering with an emphasis on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) from University of California Santa Barbara in 2020, and his MS degree in Physics with an emphasis in computational astrophysics from University of California Riverside in 2014. Prior to that, he received two B.S. degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Physics from Sharif University of Technology in Iran in 2013. Pouriaâ€™s research interest lies on multiscale phenomena, and the interdependence between system behaviors at different scales. As a result, he has worked on several complex systems including galaxy clusters, cell aggregates, and atomic islands. In his current role as Postdoc, Pouria will be developing modeling tools for predicting the physical stability of high-concentration formulations of biotherapeutics.
