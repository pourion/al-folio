      Abstract={We present a theoretical framework to model the electric response of cell aggregates. We establish a coarse representation for each cell as a combination of membrane and cytoplasm dipole moments. Then we compute the effective conductivity of the resulting system, and thereafter derive a Fokker-Planck partial differential equation that captures the time-dependent evolution of the distribution of induced cellular polarizations in an ensemble of cells. Our model predicts that the polarization density parallel to an applied pulse follows a skewed t-distribution, while the transverse polarization density follows a symmetric t-distribution, which are in accordance with our direct numerical simulations. Furthermore, we report a reduced order model described by a coupled pair of ordinary differential equations that reproduces the average and the variance of induced dipole moments in the aggregate. We extend our proposed formulation by considering fractional order time derivatives that we find necessary to explain anomalous relaxation phenomena observed in experiments as well as our direct numerical simulations. Owing to its time-domain formulation, our framework can be easily used to consider nonlinear membrane effects or intercellular couplings that arise in several scientific, medical and technological applications.},

  abstract={We propose a novel composite framework to find unknown fields in the context of inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs). We blend the high expressibility of deep neural networks as universal function estimators with the accuracy and reliability of existing numerical algorithms for partial differential equations as custom layers in semantic autoencoders. Our design brings together techniques of computational mathematics, machine learning and pattern recognition under one umbrella to incorporate domain-specific knowledge and physical constraints to discover the underlying hidden fields. The network is explicitly aware of the governing physics through a hard-coded PDE solver layer in contrast to most existing methods that incorporate the governing equations in the loss function or rely on trainable convolutional layers to discover proper discretizations from data. This subsequently focuses the computational load to only the discovery of the hidden fields and therefore is more data efficient. We call this architecture Blended inverse-PDE networks (hereby dubbed BiPDE networks) and demonstrate its applicability for recovering the variable diffusion coefficient in Poisson problems in one and two spatial dimensions, as well as the diffusion coefficient in the time-dependent and nonlinear Burgers' equation in one dimension. We also show that this approach is robust to noise.}

  abstract={We introduce a numerical framework that enables unprecedented direct numerical studies of the electropermeabilization effects of a cell aggregate at the meso-scale. Our simulations qualitatively replicate the shadowing effect observed in experiments and reproduce the time evolution of the impedance of the cell sample in agreement with the trends observed in experiments. This approach sets the scene for performing homogenization studies for understanding the effect of tissue environment on the efficiency of electropermeabilization. We employ a forest of Octree grids along with a Voronoi mesh in a parallel environment that exhibits excellent scalability. We exploit the electric interactions between the cells through a nonlinear phenomenological model that is generalized to account for the permeability of the cell membranes. We use the Voronoi Interface Method (VIM) to accurately capture the sharp jump in the electric potential on the cell boundaries. The case study simulation covers a volume of 1mm^3 with more than 27,000 well-resolved cells with a heterogeneous mix of morphologies that are randomly distributed throughout a spheroid region.},

  abstract={We introduce an approach for simulating epitaxial growth by use of an island dynamics model on a forest of quadtree grids, and in a parallel environment. To this end, we use a parallel framework introduced in the context of the level-set method. This framework utilizes: discretizations that achieve a second-order accurate level-set method on non-graded adaptive Cartesian grids for solving the associated free boundary value problem for surface diffusion; and an established library for the partitioning of the grid. We consider the cases with: irreversible aggregation, which amounts to applying Dirichlet boundary conditions at the island boundary; and an asymmetric (Ehrlich–Schwoebel) energy barrier for attachment/detachment of atoms at the island boundary, which entails the use of a Robin boundary condition. We provide the scaling analyses performed on the Stampede supercomputer and numerical examples that illustrate the capability of our methodology to efficiently simulate different aspects of epitaxial growth. The combination of adaptivity and parallelism in our approach enables simulations that are several orders of magnitude faster than those reported in the recent literature and, thus, provides a viable framework for the systematic study of mound formation on crystal surfaces.},

  abstract={Galaxy clusters contain a large population of low-mass dwarf elliptical galaxies whose exact origin is unclear: their colours, structural properties and kinematics differ substantially from those of dwarf irregulars in the field. We use the Illustris cosmological simulation to study differences in the assembly histories of dwarf galaxies (3 × 108 < M*/M⊙ < 1010) according to their environment. We find that cluster dwarfs achieve their maximum total and stellar mass on average ∼8 and ∼4.5 Gyr ago (or redshifts z = 1.0 and 0.4, respectively), around the time of infall into the clusters. In contrast, field dwarfs not subjected to environmental stripping reach their maximum mass at z = 0. These different assembly trajectories naturally produce a colour bimodality, with blue isolated dwarfs and redder cluster dwarfs exhibiting negligible star formation today. The cessation of star formation happens over median times 3.5–5 Gyr depending on stellar mass, and shows a large scatter (∼1–8 Gyr), with the lower values associated with starburst events that occur at infall through the virial radius or pericentric passages. We argue that such starbursts together with the early assembly of cluster dwarfs can provide a natural explanation for the higher specific frequency of globular clusters (GCs) in cluster dwarfs, as found observationally. We present a simple model for the formation and stripping of GCs that supports this interpretation. The origin of dwarf ellipticals in clusters is, therefore, consistent with an environmentally driven evolution of field dwarf irregulars. However, the z = 0 field analogues of cluster dwarf progenitors have today stellar masses a factor of ∼3 larger – a difference arising from the early truncation of star formation in cluster dwarfs.},
